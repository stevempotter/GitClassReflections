Lesson 3 Notes and reflections
Udacity class on Git and GutHub
Steve M. Potter Dec. 2015

Q1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

   A. Especially important if you are working on a project collaboratively. Also, if you are worried about losing a local copy
   of your work due to theft, drive crash, or other lossage. Or if you are working on your project from a variety of computers, some
   of which are not your own. But if you have a super-secret project that should not be leaked out into the public domain, pushing it 
   into the cloud might be a bad idea. 

Q2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    A. Something local might get overwritten? I suppose it depends on where the most current changes are being made, locally or on 
    GitHub.
