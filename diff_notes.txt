I am going thru the Git class to learn about version control. The first exercise I did was to download two versions of an asteroids game, and try to find a typo in one. I used the diff command:

$ diff -u oldgame.js  newgame.js

and it output in the terminal window lines that had been changed as being added + or removed -

The typo was .spacr instead of .space in the name of a variable for which key to use to fire the engines.

I found it fairly easily. I noted in an earlier part of the class where they had the two versions i
side by side that I can easly merge the two images and find differenes in code that way.
 I wonder if any other coders do this regularly?
