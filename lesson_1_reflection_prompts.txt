How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	It found the line(s) of code to focus my attention on. I still had to scrutinize someone else's 
code and decide if the change was intentional or not. Other lines had intentional changes.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?


I might remind myself of useful code snippets that I had forgotten about, or did not understand when I 
first used or found them. 


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

I would much rather have them auto-saved. I may forget to save and lost important things.
But to manually save make sure that the version saved is a good one. Autosaving may save lots of crappy 
intermediate versions that have lots of bugs.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Some projects use lots of interconnected files. Others don't.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log shows a temporal list of all the commits in a repository. Find the two of relevance, copy their IDs and use git diff IDa IDb to compare the two.
I set the git config to make lines colored if they were changed.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

I often need to try out a new programming idea or perhaps am just using a method temporarily, such as during
a demo, where user interaction will be different. So instead of making a whole new Demo mode, I can change 
it and change it back later to the previous working version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I would like to keep versions of the SunRisa program all organized and tidy.

I would like to use it to keep versions of tutorials I do to learn Java and 
Android Studio programming for app development.

I would like to write my own app from scratch for the SunRisa instead of using 
App Inventor.
