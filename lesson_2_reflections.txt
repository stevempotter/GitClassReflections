Here are some notes from/for Lesson 2 of the GIT Class.

Q. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A. Git creates the .git directory containing the metadata needed to keep track of files and whatnot.
You need to do this so that git can get busy doing its thing.

Q. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A. I guess the staging area is a place to group things together that will be committed together later. 
I assume there is only one staging area per repository, and that you don't leave things there uncommitted
for very long.
